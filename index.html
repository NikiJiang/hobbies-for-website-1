  	<h2> Reading Mystery/Adventure Novels</h2>
  	<p> During my spare time, I would venture into the thrilling worlds of my favorite mystery/adventure novels. I love the thrill of trying to solve the mystery but realize the truth was deeper than imagined. These are the moments where I can escape from reality and these are some of my favorite mystery/adventure novels! Enjoy! </p>

  	<h2> Watching Animes/Reading Manga</h2>
  	<p> I love watching animes. I also enjoyed the graphics and how well the animations are made. When I can't watch animes, I would always borrow some manga from my library which I read during my free time. Sometimes when you are too lazy to read words, watching/ reading pictures is such a relaxing and enjoyable hobby. These are some of my favorite animes/manga to read/watch. </p>

  	<h2> Learning new things</h2>
<p> Sometimes during my breaks I would pick up and learn things that are pretty random and these "hobbies" are done irregularly. I would sometimes learn new skills on how to paint something better. I am trying to learn how to knit and crochet. I learned how to play the chess and playing chess games with my little sister. I am learning few words from different languages. I am trying to learn how to play notes on my guitar. I am trying out new cook recipes.  </p>
